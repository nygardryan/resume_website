# About Me

## Professional Journey

I'm a passionate software engineer with a unique path into technology. Starting with an Associate's degree in Business from LDS Business College, I discovered my love for coding through Bottega's Ruby on Rails bootcamp. This foundation in business combined with technical skills has given me a well-rounded perspective on building software that not only works well but also serves real business needs.

## Career Evolution

My career has been marked by continuous growth and adaptation. I began as a Manual QA Engineer at Fortem, a drone defense company, where I learned the fundamentals of software testing and gained hands-on experience with networking, DevOps tools, and automation. This role taught me the importance of thorough testing and gave me exposure to complex systems integration.

At SocialClimb, I evolved from QA Automation Engineer to Full Stack Engineer, demonstrating my ability to grow within an organization. I led the development of innovative Selenium frameworks using component-based architecture and built distributed testing systems handling 750+ automated tests. My promotion to Full Stack Engineer allowed me to work on complex database optimizations, API integrations, and scalable system architecture.

Currently at RLDatix, I'm leading the development of cutting-edge AI-powered chatbot applications for healthcare incident reporting. This role combines my technical expertise with my passion for creating solutions that make a real difference in people's lives.

## Technical Philosophy

I believe software should be structured to match reality. Just as frontend development uses components, so should testing frameworks use components. This philosophy has guided my approach to building maintainable, scalable systems throughout my career.

I'm passionate about performance optimization, having worked extensively with databases containing hundreds of millions of rows. I understand that good software isn't just about functionality—it's about efficiency, maintainability, and user experience.

## Key Strengths

- **Problem Solving**: I thrive in fast-paced environments where I can tackle complex technical challenges
- **Self-Direction**: I'm comfortable taking initiative and finding ways to add value, even with minimal supervision
- **Continuous Learning**: From networking fundamentals to AI/LLM integration, I'm always expanding my technical knowledge
- **Team Leadership**: I've trained new team members and led technical initiatives across multiple organizations
- **Business Acumen**: My business education helps me understand the broader context of technical decisions

## Current Focus

I'm deeply interested in AI and machine learning applications, particularly how they can be integrated into practical business solutions. My work with LangGraph, vector embeddings, and RAG implementations has given me hands-on experience with the latest AI technologies.

I'm also passionate about creating developer-friendly tools and frameworks that make complex tasks more manageable for teams.

## Personal Interests

When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and staying current with industry trends. I believe in the power of technology to solve real-world problems and am always looking for opportunities to make a positive impact through software development.

## Looking Forward

I'm excited about the future of software development, particularly the intersection of AI and traditional software engineering. I'm always open to new challenges and opportunities to grow both technically and professionally.
